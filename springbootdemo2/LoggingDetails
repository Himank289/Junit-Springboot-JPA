Logger levels:


trace will show all below level messages annd so on for below methods.
debug
info
war
error


BY DEFAULT - info mode is on in all packages.So by default all info,warn,error,fatal messages 
will be visible as they are more severe than info level.
So Logger.info,logger.warn,logger.error by default visible
but logger.debug () and logger.trace() are not visible for info level. as it is less severe than info level.

if we explicitly set: logging.level.fullpackagename :DEBUG in application properties then only for classes in these packages, it will show all messages of debug level and more severe level i.e, info,error,warn,fatal
debug level is on: show all level msgs as well as info and above/more severe i.e. warn,error etc.
